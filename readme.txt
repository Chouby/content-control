Restrict content to logged in/out users or specific user roles. Restrict access to certain parts of a page/post. Control the visibility of widgets.

== Description ==

Content Control is a lightweight and powerful plugin that allows you to take complete control of your websiteâ€™s content by restricting access to pages/posts to logged in users, specific user roles or to logged out users.

The plugin also enables you to restrict access to certain parts of a page/post using shortcodes e.g [content_control]Logged in content[/content_control]

Lastly, the plugin allows you to control the visibility of each sidebar/footer widget by selecting who can view each widget (everyone, logged out users, logged in users, specific user roles).
